# StrumItUp
Automatic guitar player that presses chords and strums to any song on the internet!

## Personal Statement

It all started when our team member (definitely not Parth), let's call him Marth, had a crush on a girl who was a big fan of guitar music. He decided to impress her by playing her favorite song on the guitar, but there was one problem - Jake had never played the guitar before.

Determined to win her over, Marth spent weeks practicing the song, but he just couldn't get the hang of it. He even resorted to using YouTube tutorials, but it was no use. He was about to give up when he had a crazy idea - what if he could make the guitar play the song for him?

That's when our team got to work. We spent months developing an attachment that could automatically parse any song from the internet and play it on the guitar. We used innovative arm technology to strum the strings and servos on the headstock to press the chords, ensuring perfect sound every time.

Finally, the day arrived for Marth to show off his new invention to the girl of his dreams. He nervously set up the attachment on his guitar and selected her favorite song. As the guitar began to play, the girl was amazed. She couldn't believe how effortlessly Marth was playing the song. Little did she know, he had a secret weapon!

Marth's invention not only won over the girl, but it also sparked the idea for our revolutionary product. Now, guitar players of all levels can effortlessly play any song they desire. And it all started with a boy, a crush, and a crazy idea.

## Inspiration

Our product, Strum it Up, was inspired by one team member's struggle to impress a girl with his guitar skills. After realizing he couldn't play, he and the team set out to create a solution that would allow anyone to play any song on the guitar with ease.

## What it does

Strum it Up is an attachment for the guitar that automatically parses any song from the internet and uses an innovative arm technology to strum the strings and servos on the headstock to help press the chords, ensuring perfect sound every time.

## How we built it

We spent hours developing Strum it Up using a combination of hardware and software. We used APIs to parse songs from the internet, custom-built arm technology to strum the strings, and servos on the headstock to press the chords.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we faced was ensuring that the guitar attachment could accurately strum and press the chords on a wide range of guitar models. This was because different models have different actions (action is the height between strings and the fretboard, the more the height, the harder you need to press the string) We also had to ensure that the sound quality was top-notch and that the attachment was easy to use.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're incredibly proud of the final product - Strum it Up. It's a game-changer for guitar players of all levels and allows anyone to play any song with ease. We're also proud of the innovative technology we developed, which has the potential to revolutionize the music industry.

## What we learned

Throughout the development process, we learned a lot about guitar playing, sound engineering, and hardware development. We also learned the importance of persistence, dedication, and teamwork when it comes to bringing a product to market.

## What's next for Strum it Up

We're excited to see where Strum it Up will take us next. We plan to continue improving the attachment, adding new features, and expanding our reach to guitar players all over the world. We also hope to explore how our technology can be used in other musical applications.
